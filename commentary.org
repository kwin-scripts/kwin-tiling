* TODO EDGECASES, EDGECASES, EDGECASES!
** TODO Doesn't tile properly when screen disappears
** TODO Resolution changes
   Almost possible, but clientArea returns the _old_ resolution
* DONE Avoid struts
  Almost finished, but doesn't directly react to changes
  Needs an additional kwin signal
** DONE Halflayout
** DONE Spirallayout
** DONE Bladelayout
* TODO Testing
** Weird apps (mplayer, gimp)
   Add those to rules by default
** Weird configurations
** Multi-monitor
** DONE Multiple workspaces (e.g. moving windows across, in floating and tiling mode)
** Crashes
** DONE Graphic issues
   e.g. Steam doesn't update properly after resize
** Better release process (i.e. don't just pack up git, TEST)
* TODO Layouts
** DONE Refactor layouts to share more code
   See [[https://github.com/copycat-killer/vain-again][vain]]
   This uses a simple "arrange" function as the layout function
** TODO More/better layouts
** Implement BladeLayout as HalfLayout with masterCount == tiles.length
** Multi-master in spirallayout
* TODO Crazy stuff
** Layout switcher
** Indicate layout/state (tiling on/off) somehow
** Per-activity settings
   Huge complexity increase (one additional layer on top of desktops/screens)
   Investigate how the actual relationship between activities and desktops/clients is
   Seems to be the following:
   Each client belongs to multiple activities, but is on the same desktop on each
   There can only be one activity at the same time
*** Needs changes in tilingmanager (large) and maybe tile and tilelist
** DONE Add option to add some gaps between windows
   This could just be another layout
** React on configuration change
   Right now kwin restarts are needed every time the configuration is changed
* TODO Report
** Bugs
*** INPROGRESS ClientArea doesn't update
	https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330099
*** INPROGRESS no tabGroup
	https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330100
*** INPROGRESS windowClosed's "deleted" not properly converted
	https://bugs.kde.org/show_bug.cgi?id=330102
*** Pixmap issue
	Seems it corrupts when clients are resized before windowShown (when compositing)
	There are other cases, though, like firefox resizing after restoring the previous session
*** Borders aren't raised properly
*** KWin maximizes windows automatically on certain conditions
	Possibly caused by electricBorderMaximize
*** QML doesn't draw stuff
*** options.useCompositing/compositingMode doesn't keep up
	It does not change to false when disabling compositing
** Documentation
*** ClientArea options
*** conditions/guarantees (e.g. is windowClosed always executed before FFM selects new activeClient?)
*** Difference between geometryChanged and geometryShapeChanged
	geometryChanged fires on geometryShapeChanged and a few other signals
*** windowClosed is only fired when compositing
** Wishes
*** Integration with rules
*** Some way to draw small window borders
	Outline doesn't work as it darkens the window and consumes mouse input
	Effect?
*** Handle maximize like minimize in the scripting API
* INPROGRESS Document
** INPROGRESS A usage section
** DONE A goals section
* Remove duplicate functionality
* Refactor and beautify code
** Use "filter" etc more often
** Remove duplicate code
