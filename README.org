* kwin-tiling

  Tiling script for kwin, based on [[https://github.com/mgottschlag/kwin-tiling][Mathias Gottschlag's version]]

** Goals:
   The purpose of this is to create a userfriendly tiling solution that

   - Integrates well with KDE Plasma

   - Works for the general case
	 More sophisticated users may prefer dedicated tiling window managers
   - Provides most of the advantages of a tiling WM in a fully composited environment
	 Window previews and effects alongside different tiling layouts
   - Does not require the user to delve into scripting to get a sane configuration
** Features:
   - Four layouts, one with support for multiple "master" windows and another one with dynamic tiling capabilities (similar to i3wm's)

   - Support for minimizing and unminimizing windows

   - Support for setting windows to floating or quitting tiling altogether, per-desktop (Meta+Shift+F11) and per-window (Meta-f)
     ("Meta" refers to the "super" or "windows" key here)

   - Support for a list of ignored windows in configuration (by class)

   - An option to start windows at the master position (like in xmonad)

   - Mouse resizing

   - Useractionsmenu and keybinding (Meta+f) for toggling tiling/floating

   - An option to turn off borders for tiled windows

   - A hotkey to tile once

   - Many bugfixes over mgottschlag's version

** Installation:

   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   git clone https://github.com/kwin-scripts/kwin-tiling.git
   cd kwin-tiling/
   plasmapkg2 --type kwinscript -i .
   #+END_SRC
   
   or if updating
   
   #+BEGIN_SRC bash
   plasmapkg2 --type kwinscript -u .
   #+END_SRC

** Usage:
   Install

   Move windows around and see that they are tiled :-)

   Resize windows to resize the tiles

   Declare shortcuts (in Systemsettings->Shortcuts_and_Gestures->Global_Keyboard_Shortcuts)
   for resize, minimize and maximize operations.

   Press Meta-Shift-PgUp or Meta-Shift-PgDn to switch the layout

   Use the configuration menu (in System Settings->Window Management->KWin Scripts)

** Comprehesive list of keyboard shorcuts:

** Troubleshooting:
   No configuration option is available for the KWin Scripts entry

   - [[https://github.com/faho/kwin-tiling/issues/79#issuecomment-311465357][As suggested by @BenoitZugmeyer]],
     #+BEGIN_SRC bash
     mkdir -p ~/.local/share/kservices5
     ln -s ~/.local/share/kwin/scripts/kwin-script-tiling/metadata.desktop ~/.local/share/kservices5/kwin-script-tiling.desktop
     #+END_SRC
