* kwin-tiling

  Tiling script for kwin, based on [[https://github.com/mgottschlag/kwin-tiling][Mathias Gottschlag's version]]

** Goals:
   The purpose of this is to create a userfriendly tiling solution that

   - Integrates well with KDE Plasma

   - Works for the general case
	 More sophisticated users may prefer dedicated tiling window managers
   - Provides most of the advantages of a tiling WM in a fully composited environment
	 Window previews and effects alongside different tiling layouts
   - Does not require the user to delve into scripting to get a sane configuration
** Features:
   - Three layouts, one with support for multiple "master" windows

   - Support for minimizing and unminimizing windows

   - Support for setting windows to floating or quitting tiling altogether, per-desktop (Meta+Shift+F11) and per-window (Meta-f)
     ("Meta" refers to the "super" or "windows" key here)

   - Support for a list of ignored windows in configuration (by class)

   - An option to start windows at the master position (like in xmonad)

   - Mouse resizing

   - Useractionsmenu and keybinding (Meta+f) for toggling tiling/floating

   - An option to turn off borders for tiled windows

   - A hotkey to tile once

   - Many bugfixes over mgottschlag's version
** Installation:

   git clone https://github.com/faho/kwin-tiling.git

   cd kwin-tiling/

   plasmapkg --type kwinscript -i .

** Usage
   Install

   Move windows around and see that they are tiled :-)

   Resize windows to resize the tiles
   
   Press M-PgUp or M-PgDn to switch the layout

   Use the configuration menu (in Systemsettings->Window Behavior->Scripts)

** Known Issues:
   Activities aren't handled at all

   Clients with min/maxSize may not tile properly

   Multimonitor is untested
